- name: Setup ansible? (probably will do this when i setup my rpi from scratch.)
while this file will be empty for a bit, this is what i  would wanna do with it.

so with a new host i would just install ansible-core.
but also need passlib as a pip package for the init-setup, but also install collections (not sure if these are auto downloaded now)
Technically i can then setup the system initially, but ansible-navigator would be missing.
The config is there but the pip stuff not, its a bit annoying how to use navigator outside of rhel eco system, so i would addtional need to

install with apt libonig-dev
python3 -m venv ansible-navigator-venv
pip install ansible-navigator
source ansible-navigator-venv/bin/activate # sigh

then a start point is nicely setup.
